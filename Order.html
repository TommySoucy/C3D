<h1>How to order a print</h1>
<p>Contact me by email: soucy.tommy@gmail.com<br/>Or look me up on facebook <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/tommy.soucy">(Tommy Soucy)</a> and message me.
                        I'll probably answer within a few seconds if I'm not busy.</p>
<p>I'll probably set up some kind of form you can fill up as I go through SOEN 287.</p>
<h2>How it all works</h2>
<ol>
    <li>You give me a model/Idea/Concept you want to print</li>
    <li>If needed, I model or modify an existing model myself. That might bring the price up, but not by much (Depends on how much work needs to be done and how time consuming the job is)</li>
    <li>Depending on what you want I prepare a file to print (I "slice" whatever model we have) depending on the exact specifications you want.<br/>
        This could include but is not limited to things like:
        <ul>
            <li>Layer height (0.05mm - 0.6mm)</li>
            <li>Supports</li>
            <li>Material</li>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Infill shape and percentage</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I demo to you the current model</li>
    <li>You then tell me what to modify, going back and forth until you are satisfied</li>
    <li>I add you to the queue. Keep in mind I only have 1 printer right now. I might not be able to print your thing right away.</li>
    <li>Once your stuff is printed we set up a meeting time at school so I can give it to you or you come pick it up</li>
    <li>You pay me cash or however we can make it work until I figure out how to make an online paying system or something (Check the prices by clicking <a href="Prices.html">here</a>)</li>
