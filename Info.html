<h1>About C3D</h1>
<p>You don't have a 3D printer? You want something printed? You don't want to go to your local public 3D printers? You go at concordia?</p>
<p>Good. Hit me up by email and tell me the details. Once the print is done, we set up a meet time at school and i give it to you in person.</p>
<p>Not only more efficient than public 3D printers but also less pricey and more discrete. Whatever you ask me to print, if i can, i will.</p>
<h2>Printer specs</h2>
<p>I currently have a single PRUSA MK2S MMU2.0</p>
<p>That bad boy can print 5 different colors/materials* at once with a max volume of 20cmx21cmx20cm ()</p>
